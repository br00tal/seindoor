seindoor
--------

seindoor is a python script to play audio files when a reed (door) sensor is
opened.  The original intent was to play the Seinfeld bass riff whenever the
door was opened, but any audio file can technically be played.

Usage
-----

./seindoor.py [/path/to/configfile]

The config file argument is optional.  If not specified, the default config
(seindoor.conf) is loaded.

Dependencies
------------

- Raspberry Pi
- Magnetic reed (door) sensor
- Python 3
- RPi.GPIO Python library
- Some sort of speaker
- Audio files (mp3s, wavs, etc.)
- An audio player (i.e. mpg123, mplayer)
