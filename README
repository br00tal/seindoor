seindoor
--------

seindoor is a python script to play audio files when a reed (door) sensor is
opened.  The original intent was to play the Seinfeld bass riff whenever the
door was opened, but any audio file can technically be played.

Usage
-----

Ad-hoc, non-daemon mode:

./seindoor.py [/path/to/configfile]

The config file argument is optional.  If not specified, the default config
(seindoor.conf) is loaded.

As a service via systemd:

make install
systemctl start seindoor@example

This will start seindoor as a service loading the /etc/seindoor/example.conf
config file.  The daemon method *requires* a config file to be specified.
You also need to set a full path to the audio files in the config file.

Dependencies
------------

- Raspberry Pi
- Magnetic reed (door) sensor
- Python 3
- RPi.GPIO Python library
- Some sort of speaker
- Audio files (mp3s, wavs, etc.)
- An audio player (i.e. mpg123, mplayer)
- systemd (for daemon mode) (optional)
